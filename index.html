            Today, I wondered where you’ve gone,<br>
            The paths we walked, now overgrown.<br>
            The games we played, where laughter rang,<br>
            Are now just echoes, a distant pang.<br><br>

            I still play those games, but not the same,<br>
            With different hands, they’ve lost their flame.<br>
            I bought a game meant for two,<br>
            Hoping one day, I'd find someone new.<br><br>

            But the truth I can't deny or mend,<br>
            It was you I loved, though you called me a friend.<br>
            I miss your smile, though it’s not enough,<br>
            To bring you back, or ease the rough.<br><br>

            How did we break what once seemed whole?<br>
            This lingering ache, it scars the soul.<br>
            The letters I wrote, now lost in the drain,<br>
            Words of love, swallowed by pain.<br><br>

            I tore them up, flushed them away,<br>
            Yet the feelings remain, refusing to stray.<br>
            My heart remembers, though time has passed,<br>
            No anger left, just love that lasts.<br><br>

            Your face, it lingers, it won’t erase,<br>
            But the hurt has faded, leaving only grace.<br>
            I miss you still, in the quiet of night,<br>
            But the weight is lighter, the burden slight.<br><br>

            All I hold now are memories sweet,<br>
            Of the times we shared, now incomplete.<br>
            Yet here I stand, with a heart set free,<br>
            Playing games, waiting for someone who'll see.<br><br>

            For love, it’s gentle, though it sometimes burns,<br>
            And I know one day, it will return.
