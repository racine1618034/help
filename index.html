            <h1>My Words</h1>
            <div class="poem">
                Today, I wondered where you’ve gone,<br>
                The paths we walked, now overgrown.<br>
                The games we played, where laughter rang,<br>
                Are now just echoes, a distant pang.<br><br>

                I still play those games, but not the same,<br>
                With different hands, they’ve lost their flame.<br>
                I bought a game meant for two,<br>
                Hoping one day, I'd find someone new.<br><br>

                But the truth I can't deny or mend,<br>
                It was you I loved, though you called me a friend.<br>
                I miss your smile, though it’s not enough,<br>
                To bring you back, or ease the rough.<br><br>

                How did we break what once seemed whole?<br>
                This lingering ache, it scars the soul.<br>
                The letters I wrote, now lost in the drain,<br>
                Words of love, swallowed by pain.<br><br>

                I tore them up, flushed them away,<br>
                Yet the feelings remain, refusing to stray.<br>
                My heart remembers, though time has passed,<br>
                No anger left, just love that lasts.<br><br>

                Your face, it lingers, it won’t erase,<br>
                But the hurt has faded, leaving only grace.<br>
                I miss you still, in the quiet of night,<br>
                But the weight is lighter, the burden slight.<br><br>

                All I hold now are memories sweet,<br>
                Of the times we shared, now incomplete.<br>
                Yet here I stand, with a heart set free,<br>
                Playing games, waiting for someone who'll see.<br><br>

                For love, it’s gentle, though it sometimes burns,<br>
                And I know one day, it will return.

            <h1>Sonnet CXLVII by William Shakespeare</h1>
            <div class="poem">
                My love is as a fever longing still,<br>
                For that which longer nurseth the disease;<br>
                Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,<br>
                The uncertain sickly appetite to please.<br><br>

                My reason, the physician to my love,<br>
                Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,<br>
                Hath left me, and I desperate now approve<br>
                Desire is death, which physic did except.<br><br>

                Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,<br>
                And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;<br>
                My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,<br>
                At random from the truth vainly expressed;<br><br>

                For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,<br>
                Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
            </div>

            <div class="commentary">
                Perhaps as a natural continuation of the renunciation of the previous sonnet, or perhaps independently of it, the poet here reflects on his woeful state. He is like a patient in a fever who has been declared by the physician to be past cure. All his thoughts and words are like those of madmen, and everything is uttered at random, without any coherence. His fever lends him words, and although he cannot explain his infatuation, he feels it to be wrong, and yet he is compelled to continue drinking and eating the same noxious food which brought on his disease in the first place. Hence there is no escape for him, and he sees himself trapped in the black vortex of hell in which his mistress resides, and there is no release from the darkness.
