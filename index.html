            <h2>Steam Summer Sale - 2024 </h2>
            Today, I wondered where you’ve gone,<br>
            The paths we walked, now overgrown.<br>
            The games we played, where laughter rang,<br>
            Are now just echoes, a distant pang.<br><br>

            I still play those games, but not the same,<br>
            With different hands, they’ve lost their flame.<br>
            I bought a game meant for two,<br>
            Hoping one day, I'd find someone new.<br><br>

            But the truth I can't deny or mend,<br>
            It was you I loved, though you called me a friend.<br>
            I miss your smile, though it’s not enough,<br>
            To bring you back, or ease the rough.<br><br>

            How did we break what once seemed whole?<br>
            This lingering ache, it scars the soul.<br>
            The letters I wrote, now lost in the drain,<br>
            Words of love, swallowed by pain.<br><br>

            I tore them up, flushed them away,<br>
            Yet the feelings remain, refusing to stray.<br>
            My heart remembers, though time has passed,<br>
            No anger left, just love that lasts.<br><br>

            Your face, it lingers, it won’t erase,<br>
            But the hurt has faded, leaving only grace.<br>
            I miss you still, in the quiet of night,<br>
            But the weight is lighter, the burden slight.<br><br>

            All I hold now are memories sweet,<br>
            Of the times we shared, now incomplete.<br>
            Yet here I stand, with a heart set free,<br>
            Playing games, waiting for someone who'll see.<br><br>

            For love, it’s gentle, though it sometimes burns,<br>
            And I know one day, it will return.

            <h2>Passenger seat - 2021 </h2>
            But here she was again<br>
            Listening to the same old songs over<br>
            And over again<br>
            Sometimes she comes back to her senses<br>
            To her old sayings<br>
            To her old poems, essays, words and<br>
            The most importantly<br>
            Old memories<br><br>

            And then she remembers only the good parts<br>
            Good for her<br>
            But she knows the bad parts though existed<br>
            How can you be so sure? asked the driver<br>
            Traces, she said<br>
            They are all over my heart<br>
            Permanent marks that will never leave<br>
            Due to the bad assembly that was made<br>
            Imagine trying to fix a bell jar while it cuts through your flesh<br>
            After each incident that tore away her heart into pieces<br>
            Indeed it had to be reassembled<br>
            But the assembly that was done once before wouldn’t be called so<br>
            Good either, but it did get the job done<br>
            Maybe that’s why it kept breaking<br>
            It was her fault anyways<br>
            Why would you have a glass heart<br>
            That could be shattered into a million pieces?<br><br>

            Throughout the years she made a fool of herself<br>
            Maybe people weren’t clever enough to understand this fact either<br>
            But<br>
            Apparently her heart was a huge black hole<br>
            Make-believe that lasted through her high school years<br>
            She felt as cool as “A refrigerator that has to be cooled”<br>
            Isn’t it funny, making up a lie<br>
            Just to protect yourself from the cruelty of people, of their empty hearts<br>
            Really empty hearts<br>
            Type of hearts that just pump blood<br><br>

            So she told herself<br>
            What was the point of hiding my heart away<br>
            Decided to take a leap of faith<br>
            She still wonders to this day<br>
            If falling taught her anything<br>
            Taking risks, and giving her heart away to a little spoiled boy<br>
            The little one thought my heart was a magic 8 ball<br>
            That he got for Christmas<br>
            Shook it around a couple of times, got some answers, got curious<br>
            How did it work<br>
            Couldn’t figure out the physics behind it<br>
            Then got bored<br>
            Didn’t ask his parents<br>
            Didn’t try to understand,<br>
            And made zero efforts<br>
            He had a bunch of other toys anyway<br>
            Why try to figure out a ball that gives you random answers?<br>
            He tossed it aside<br>
            The ball rolled over<br>
            Stopped under the bed<br>
            And there it was<br>
            Made friends with the dust and the old Hot Wheels car<br>
            Waiting to be sold to another family<br><br>

            Could I blame the boy? she asked<br>
            The story intrigued the driver<br>
            He responded:<br>
            Depends if he ever found you back<br>
            She told him<br>
            You don’t get people, do you?<br>
            Little spoiled kids rest little spoiled kids unless<br>
            Their house got burned down<br>
            It’s a funny way to stop being spoiled<br>
            And I like to burn houses down<br>
            Then they both looked in the rear mirror<br>
            To see the flames<br>
            But no<br>
            To answer you<br>
            The little spoiled boy never came back<br>
            He continued to swap toys<br>
            But the fundamental question is this<br>
            How would you make this boy interested in this ball

        <!-- First Story -->
        <div class="story">
            <h2>The Goat and the Watch</h2>
            Have you heard the story of the sheep with a clock, or was it a goat?<br>
            Well, the story goes like this (as far as I remember):<br>
            The goat carried a heavy gold watch on a chain around its neck, and it tired him all the time.<br>
            Not only was the watch a burden, but it also didn't work.<br>
            One day, the rabbit, a friend of the goat, asked him why he carries this old heavy watch that isn't working anymore.<br>
            It looks heavy, said the rabbit.<br>
            The goat goes, yeah, you are right, it's heavy, but I've grown used to it.<br>
            To its weight, and the fact that the hand doesn't move and always shows the same thing.<br>
            One afternoon on the goat's birthday, the rabbit hands him a new watch that's glittering, really lightweight, and in perfect condition.<br>
            The goat happily hangs the watch from his neck and runs around to show it to his friends.<br>
            'You are the goat, I'm the rabbit, and the watch is your heart,' said the doctor.<br>
            'I tricked you, didn't I?' .<br>
            I love my solitude, but I'm starting to see life is too big to fit one life into it.<br>
            Hopefully, my life won't end in the near future.<br>
            Hopefully, you will be happy with your own philosophy, but most importantly, I wish you love in any form or structure you want.

        <!-- Second Story -->
        <div class="story">
            <h2>Letters Never Sent</h2>
            So I write to him again, the letters I will never send.<br>
            I miss him, or maybe I just miss loving him.<br>
            Loving someone, for the first and only time... <br>
            Now all alone again, naturally. <br>

            Sometimes I just wanna call him and tell him all, all about whats going on, how sad I am, how much I miss him, without waiting anything in return. I guess my anger has disappeared and all i have left for him is the love that was overshadow by my anger. Each time i listen to love songs, it reminds me of him, and his pretty voice and touch. I feel like a monster, that doesnt deserve anything… even though i did nothing wrong but love him too much. As sick as it sounds I loved him more. Someone should hold me down before I tell him everything.
